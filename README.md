# MathTutor
By: Benji Kallen
Creates randomized problems from templates in algebra, geometry, and calculus. Then provides AI tutoring on wrong questions from Gemini.

Topics covered are listed below:

Algebra Topics:  
    Introductory Algebra: ax = b & ax + b = c  
    Slope-Intercept Form: y = mx + b  
    Quadratic Equations: ax^2 + bx + c = d  
    Rational Equations: a/(bx + c) = d  

Geometry Topics:  
    Straight Angles: (ax + b) + (cx) = 180  
    Vertical Angles: x = B, A = C  
    Rectangle Perimeter: P = 2l + 2w  
    Rectangle Area: A = lw  
    Triangle Area: 1/2bh  
    Circle Circumference: 2pi * r  
    Circle Area: pi * r^2  

Calculus Topics:  
    Power Rule: nx^(n - 1)  
    Antiderivative Power Rule: x^(n + 1)/(n + 1)
